/*
Chip-8 has 16 general-purpose 8-bit registers, usually referred to as Vx, where x is a hexadecimal digit (0 through F). There is also a 16-bit register called I.
Most Chip-8 programs start at location 0x200 (512)
The program counter (PC) should be 16-bit and is used to store the currently executing address. The stack pointer (SP) can be 8-bit, it is used to point to the topmost level of the stack.
The stack is an array of 16 16-bit values, used to store the address that the interpreter should  return to when finished with a subroutine. Chip-8 allows for up to 16 levels of nested subroutines.
The original implementation of the Chip-8 language used a 64x32-pixel monochrome display
